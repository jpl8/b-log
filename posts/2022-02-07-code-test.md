# Does this work?

```python
from functools import cache

@cache
def fib(n : int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1

    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

All right, so python works.
How about Haskell?

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn "Hello, B-log"
```

Great!
Rust?

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, B-log!");
}

#[non_exhaustive]
enum OpinionsOnBlog {
    Amazing,
    Awesome,
    Beautiful,
    Breathtaking
}

```
