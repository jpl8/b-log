title: The Kitty and the Bird
---

I saw a kitty jumping through a field of flowers, \
his hair was black and white. \
He hipped and hopped with such raw power \
I thought that he'd take flight. \

He saw a bird. \
He crouched beneath \
the daisies and the grass. \

He wiggled his bottom, \
he lept on upon him, \
and the bird was dead, alas.
