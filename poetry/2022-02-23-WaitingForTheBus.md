title: Waiting for the Bus
---


I was waiting for the bus \
when I felt it in the air. \
The perfume of a ghost \
oh so lovely and fair. \
 
I looked to the side, \
not knowing what I'd find: \
no one was there, \
t'was a trick of the mind. \
 
I leaned back on the bench, \
my heart slowing it's pace, \
and I thought of your hair, \
your eyes and your face. \
 
The bus came and went, \
but the wait was well spent. \

I enjoyed being with you, \
we should do this again. \
