title: Let the World watch
---

Let the world watch in horror,  
as people are dragged into graves,  
as their boots march on out,  
and their blood is spilt in waves.  
  
Let the world watch in fear,  
as shells light the sky ablaze,  
for Gods and Kings and Men,  
justified in a hundred ways.  
  
Let the world watch in silence,  
maybe shout now and then.  
They can sit back and watch  
and think themselves wise men  
  
Because they're not the ones  
dying and saying their goodbyes.  
Soon they'll hear the roaring  
engines and feel fire in the skies.  
  
The pain of some is not of many.  
But of pain we all have plenty.  
  
Let's not hurt ourselves much further.  
Let's not remain the dull observer.
