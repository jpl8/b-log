title: My Lover and her Death
---

As that November was brought back  
in the sizzling drowning of the embers,  
I sat obsessing over all of her  
and I delved deep in futures lost.  
  
I see her smiling now in spring,  
feel the warmth of gold surround her,  
as dandelions sprout and sing  
of all the futures that I lost with her.  
  
By the riverbank in summer,  
tossing stones that hopped and sank,  
I feel the brushing of her hair  
instill in me such sweet despair.  
  
And as we crumple leaves in autumn,  
and hold hands in hopeful joy,  
that's when I finally hit the bottom  
and fall back into the void.  
  
Winter comes and so does her,  
in every shiver, every breath,  
every step a dear reminder  
of my lover and her death.
