title: Leaning back against the bark
---

Leaning back against the bark,  
Hearing the chirps of birds in spring,  
I think of you who left your mark,  
And so too do I now sing.  

I hum a tune of days long past,  
Where we would simply sit and laugh.  
Before the days when I did ask  
And you did tear my heart in half.  

It was selfish of me, now I see,  
To ask of burning love from thee.  

I wonder how it must have felt,  
To such a painful blow have dealt.
