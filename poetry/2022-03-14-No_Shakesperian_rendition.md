title: No Shakespearian rendition
---

I know this ain't a competition,  
no Shakespearian rendition  
of Romeo and Juliet,  
we haven't quite gotten there yet.  

I just know you're my volition  
my one and only ambition.  
But I fear one day I'll regret  
that summer's end in which we met.  

I don't know how long it'll be,  
I just know that eventually  
I'll wake up one day and see  
that you just weren't meant for me.
